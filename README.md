I'm attempting to build some mult-threading capabilities into [wealth-viz](https://github.com/benjaminmgross/wealth-viz), but the paradigm that I'm dealing with is as follows:

A Python     data    Multi-Threading    data      B Python
Program     =====>   `py` Program       =====>    Program

I've never piped data from one program to another, so I thought it'd be nice to make a little test case.
